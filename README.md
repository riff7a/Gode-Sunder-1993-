# Gode & Sunder (1993)

The success of the market can be attributed in part to institutional settings rather than individual human behavior, although this had not been empirically tested.

In this paper, Gode and Sunder utilized standard experimental protocols, but populated their markets with simple computerized robot traders. These traders are not designed to think strategically or engage in advanced learning or statistical modeling. They typically adhere to budget constraints and avoid trading in ways that result in financial losses. For these reasons, they are referred to as zero intelligence (ZI) traders. 

The findings demonstrate that ZI traders can effectively participate in simulated markets that market efficiency approaches 100%, and prices tend to converge towards the equilibrium price predicted by economic theory. This indicates that double auctions, a non-Walrasian market mechanism, can maintain high levels of allocative efficiency even when agents do not actively seek profit maximization. This outcome suggests that many features of economic markets may rely as much on institutional design as they do on the actual behavior of agents themselves.
